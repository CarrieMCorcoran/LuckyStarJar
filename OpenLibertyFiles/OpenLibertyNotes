Okay, so, it's not letting me upload the full openLiberty project because when you run it it generates a LOT of big files so it won't all fit on here.  So here's how to get your own OpenLiberty project to do what mine did.  I highly recommend going through 1 or 2 of the tutorials we have access to to get a basic gist of what Maven and OpenLiberty do.
1) Go here https://aguibert.github.io/openliberty-cheat-sheet/#_getting_started and download the file they link to with the settings they suggest.  The only non-default thing I did here was call the artifactID (which is like the project name?) LuckyStarJar.
2) Swap out their pom.xml and main folder with the ones I'm putting in here.
3) Open up a command prompt or terminal (whatever it's called in your OS), and navigate to the folder containing pom.xml.  Use the command mvn liberty:dev and it'll run the project just like it says in the article I linked to, except go to http://localhost:9080/data/test to check it.  If you have the database running you should see two Note objects from the database.  The server will keep running until you hit ctrl c in the command line.

HMU with any questions!
